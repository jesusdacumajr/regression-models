## Regression Modeling

The project for the Regression Models class on Coursera.

### Context

You work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:

* "Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG"
* "Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions"

### Assignment

Take the `mtcars` data set and use regression models and exploratory data analyses to write up an analysis answering their question or detail why the questions are not answerable.

* Perform some exploratory data analyses
* Correctly interpret the coefficients of your regression model
* Fit multiple regression models and detail your strategy for model selection
* Create a residual plot and perform some residual diagnostics
* Quantify the uncertainty in your conclusions and/or correctly perform statistical inference of your model
